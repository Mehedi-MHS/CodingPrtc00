REACT EVENTS
-------------

- Just like HTML DOM events, React can perform actions based on events.It has same events as HTML (click,change,mouseover etc.)

- React events are written in camelCase syntax. 'onClick' instead of 'onclick'

- React event handlers are written inside curly braces. onClick={shoot}   instead of onclick="shoot()"
