REACT HOOKS 
==================================

1: Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this,class components are generally no longer needed

2: What is a hook?
=> Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.

* You must 'import' hooks from 'react'

- 'useState' hook keeps tracks of the application state.
- State generally refers to application data or properties that need to be tracked.


Hook Rules(3)  : 
---------------
1: Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
2: Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
3: Hooks cannot be conditional

NOTE: Hooks will not work in React class components.


Custom Hooks:
----------------
If you have stateful logic that needs to be reused in several components,you can build your own custom Hooks.
