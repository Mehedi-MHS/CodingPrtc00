1: setTimeout() , Promise() are by default asynchronous
2:promise is better than callback,and async-await is better than using .then() in promise
3:"async" and "await" both are siblings. You cannot use one of them except other.
*async-await is used to write the code in synchronous way but runs the code in asynchronous way.
4: give priority in using "async-await"
5: "async-await" is only used in promise invocation(execution). Not in definition.
6:As there is no .catch() block in async await [like .then().catch() ], use try-catch instead.
*If there is no reject in promise, then simplify the code using 
Promise.resolve(messege);

instead of

var fun =new Promise(function(resolve){
  resolve(messege);
});


7:Promise.all() -> To handle multiple promises at once,use promise.all([array of promises]) method.
8:promise.race -> Competetion between promises that returns the first resolved promise result. Other promise results are skiped.
