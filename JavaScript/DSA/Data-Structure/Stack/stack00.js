//To build a stack, we first need to decide on the underlying data structure we will use to
//store the stack elements. We will use an array in our implementation.

/*Intro:
 * dataStore - The array that stores the stack elements .The constructor sets it to an empty array.
 * top - The top variable keeps track of the top of the stack and is initially set to 0 by the constructor, indicating that the 0 position of the array is the top of the stack,at least until an element is pushed onto the stack.
 * push - When we push a new element onto a stack, we have to store it in the top position and increment the top variable so that the new top is the next empty position in the array.
 * pop - The pop() function does the reverse of the push() functionâ€”it returns the element in the top position of the stack and then decrements the top variable.
 * peek - The peek operation returns the value stored at the top of a stack without removing it from the stack.
 * clear - clear a stack. simply set top variable = 0
 * length - To know number of elements stored in stack
