#palindrome:A palindrome is a word, phrase, or number that is spelled the same forward and back‚Äêward.
-We take the original string and push each character onto a stack, moving from left to right. When
the end of the string is reached, the stack contains the original string in reverse order,
with the last letter at the top of the stack and the first letter at the bottom of the stack.
