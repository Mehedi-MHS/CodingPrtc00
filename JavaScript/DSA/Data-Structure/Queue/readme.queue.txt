Queue | Data Structure
=======
•A queue is an example of a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure.(which is inserted first,that will be removed first)

•A queue is a type of list where data are inserted at the end and are removed from the front

•The two primary operations involving queues are inserting a new element into a queue
 and removing an element from a queue. The insertion operation is called enqueue, and
 the removal operation is called dequeue. The enqueue operation inserts a new element
 at the end of a queue, and the dequeue operation removes an element from the front of
 a queue

• Another important queue operation is viewing the element at the front of a queue. This
  operation is called peek. The peek operation returns the element stored at the front of
  a queue without removing it from the queue. Besides examining the front element, we
  also need to know how many elements are stored in a queue, which we can satisfy with
  the length property; and we need to be able to remove all the elements from a queue,
  which is performed with the clear operation.
