Linked List - Data Structute
=============================
1: milk-->bread-->egg-->bakon-->null
2: Header-->bread-->egg-->bakon-->null

*Null is used to identify the end of linked list.
*Header is used to identify the start of linked list.

>> we say that
“bread” follows “milk”, not that “bread” is in the second position

-A linked list is a collection of objects called nodes. Each node is linked to a successor
node in the list using an object reference. The reference to another node is called a link.



+[Linked List is an alternative of Array.]

Pros:
i)Use for storing large data.Because array can contain limited size of data
ii)Adding and removing element is easier than array

Cons:
i)Cannot access random element.It has to visit all the related nodes before visiting the actual element.


[When random access is required, an array is the better data structure to use.]
