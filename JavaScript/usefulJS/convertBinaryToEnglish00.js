/*
In JavaScript, you can convert binary to an English word by first converting the binary string to a decimal number using the parseInt() function, 
and then using that decimal number as an index to look up the corresponding character in a string of characters representing the alphabet.
Here is an example implementation:


function binaryToWord(binary) {
    // Create a string of characters representing the alphabet
    let alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';

    // Initialize an empty string to store the final word
    let word = '';

    // Iterate over each character of the binary string
    for (let i = 0; i < binary.length; i += 8) {
        // Get the next 8 characters of the binary string
        let byte = binary.slice(i, i + 8);

        // Convert the 8-character binary string to a decimal number
        let decimal = parseInt(byte, 2);

        // Get the corresponding character from the alphabet
        let character = alphabet[decimal];

        // Add the character to the final word
        word += character;
    }

    return word;
}
You can then use the function like this:


let binaryString = '01100011011010110111000001101000';
let word = binaryToWord(binaryString);
console.log(word); // 'hello'
Note that the above implementation is assuming that the input is a binary string with 8 bits per character (per byte) and the function is only returning lower case characters. You can add upper case characters, or special characters to the alphabet string, or even change the length of the slice method to change the number of bits per character. Also take into consideration that each ascii character is 8 bits and some unicode character might require more.
