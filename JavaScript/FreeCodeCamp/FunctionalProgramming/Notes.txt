FreeCodeCamp Functional Programming Notes
===========================================

1: The functions that take a function as an argument or returns a function as
   a return value,are called HigherOrderFunctions

2: When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a lambda
---------
**:  In functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome is called a side effect. A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.
----------
3: Two distinct principles for functional programming:

  i)Don't alter a variable or object - create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function. 
                                      Hint: using something like const newArr = arrVar, where arrVar is an array will simply create a reference to the existing variable and not a copy. 
                                      So changing a value in newArr would change the value in arrVar. So always make a copy of array in correct way. splice() method also changes the main array

  ii)Declare function parameters - any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments passed to the function, and not on any global object or variable.
